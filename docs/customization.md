# Customization

All files with custom settings can be found in the `config` directory in the installation directory. This should be
`~/.config` on Linux, or `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\OmniLED`.  
It can also be accessed by pressing the `Settings` menu on the tray icon after the application is running.

> _All settings are loaded on startup and then stay constant until program is restarted!_

## Applications

Setup applications and their arguments. While they try to have sensible defaults, it's worth having a look as some
settings, like the location will almost certainly be different.  
See [applications](applications.md).

## Devices

Provide a list of devices that will work with this program. This list already has some compatible devices, but you can
extend to fit your needs.  
See [devices](devices.md).

## Settings

This is pretty much self-explanatory. You can set global program settings.
See [settings](settings.md).

## User Scripts

Last but certainly not least, this is the biggest customization point of the program. Set widget layouts per view per
device, run scripts on events and on keyboard shortcuts.  
See [user scripts](user_scripts.md).
