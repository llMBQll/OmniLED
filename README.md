# Steelseries OLED

Control your SteelSeries OLED devices (and more) on Windows and Linux.

## Features

### Customizable

Don't like the layout? No problem. Using custom scripts you can configure what the screen displays and set
triggers for running your scripts.

### Extensible

Missing data you would like? Implement the gRPC client in your favourite language and send custom data to the server.

Your device not on the list? There is a great chance it will work anyway, just add an entry to the screen list and write
a transform function if necessary.
